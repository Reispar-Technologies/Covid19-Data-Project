## Covid19-Data-Project by a team at Reispar Analytics Academy

Real Time Analytics Web Page on the Corona Virus around the world

This is the Visual data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard with sources from; The World Health Organisation (WHO), Johns Hopkins University, Worldometers as key data sources.

Reispar Academy is glad to bring this project idea into fruition on the Corona virus case. This project is a Live Analytics Web application on the Covid-19 across the globe.

It combines the distinct skills of Data Science, Data (Business) Analytics, Programming, DataOps and Project Management into one web application. 

The core objective of this web application is to aid in good governance by making live data available for both private and government agencies, individuals, institutions and businesses across the world.

The web application is based on an API, which we are making open and available to the public. The descriptive data & visual analytics reveals trends in the growth cases of the virus. 

The team working on this project operated remotely to deliver it.

The API technology scraps data from the source site at an interval of 7 minutes. 

For more analysis and research using our API, see more details on the API documentation website:
